    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The spiciest curry around. Eat it, and you'll be able to attack by spitting out fireballs. The eater of the curry will soon be unable to handle the heat, however, and end up frantically dashing about the screen. This is a pretty funny sight that never gets old, especially when it's Samus or Snake. Eat this mouth-scorching dish if you dare.
        <br> its all fun and games until the curry catches fire!
