        <li>1 green olive</li>
        <li>2 thin slices of tomato</li>
        <li>1 stick of balogna (salami or ham work just as well)</li>
        <li>3 leaves of lettuce (or spinach! this will make you strong as heavy)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: Assembling the Sandwich</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the balogna into 6 slices (half an inch thick) and place 3 on the bottom bread.</li>
        <li>Add 3 slices of cheese</li>
        <li>Place 3 leaves of lettuce on top of the cheese</li>

        <li>Place the bread on top of it all</li>
        <li>cut the sandvich diagonally so it makes 2 sandviches (share the love!)<br>
        (here is what diagonal looks like)</li>
